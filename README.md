# PhD course on Foundations of Probabilistic Programming

Website of the PhD course on Foundations of Probabilistic Programming at IT University of Copenhagen, Spring 2023.

## Course description

What does a probabilistic program actually compute? How can one formally reason about such
probabilistic programs? This course covers such elementary (i.e. foundational mathematical)
questions. We give a state-of-the-art overview of the theoretical underpinnings of modern
probabilistic programming and their applications in machine learning, security, and other domains,
at a level suitable for graduate students using a recent text book by Barthe, Katoen, and Silva. The
book treats the connection between probabilistic programs and mathematical logic, security (what
is the probability that software leaks confidential information?), and presents three programming
languages for different applications: Excel tables, program testing, and approximate computing.
