# PhD course on Foundations of Probabilistic Programming

Website of the PhD course on Foundations of Probabilistic Programming at IT University of Copenhagen, Spring 2023.

The course is organized as a reading group. Each week we discuss different topics and chapters of the book *Foundations of Probabilistic Programming* by Gilles Barthe, Joost-Pieter Katoen and Alexandra Silva. [See schedule](#schedule).

#### How to sign up in the course

Send an email to [Mohsen Ghaffari](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/mohsen-ghaffari) including: your affiliation, PhD supervisor’s name, title of the PhD project, and a 100 word summary of the PhD project. Include your PhD supervisor (CC) in the email.

* **Deadline for signing-up: 15 January 2023**.

*The PhD school at IT University of Copenhagen grants <b>3 ECTS points for this course</b>. To obtain the credits, students must lead at least one of the sessions in the [schedule below](#schedule).*


## Course description

What does a probabilistic program actually compute? How can one formally reason about such probabilistic programs? This course covers such elementary (i.e. foundational mathematical) questions. We give a state-of-the-art overview of the theoretical underpinnings of modern probabilistic programming and their applications in machine learning, security, and other domains, at a level suitable for graduate students using a recent text book by Barthe, Katoen, and Silva. The book treats the connection between probabilistic programs and mathematical logic, security (what is the probability that software leaks confidential information?), and presents three programming languages for different applications: Excel tables, program testing, and approximate computing.
